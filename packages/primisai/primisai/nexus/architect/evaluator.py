class Evaluator:
    """
    Evaluates the performance of generated agentic workflows against a benchmark.

    This class provides a framework for systematically testing the quality and
    correctness of workflows created by the "Archtect" system. It operates by
    running a generated workflow against a set of predefined tasks from a
    benchmark file.

    A key feature of this evaluator is its use of a Large Language Model (LLM)
    as a "judge" to score the output of the workflow. The LLM compares the
    workflow's final result against the ground-truth or expected outcome defined
    in the benchmark, providing a flexible and nuanced assessment of performance.

        """
        Initializes the Evaluator by loading the benchmark dataset.

        This constructor configures the LLM that will act as the evaluator and
        loads the benchmark problems from the specified JSONL file. It can also
        limit the evaluation to a smaller subset of the benchmark for faster testing.

        Args:
            llm_config (Dict[str, str]): The configuration for the Language Model
                that will be used as the AI judge for scoring the results.
            benchmark_path (str): The file path to the benchmark dataset. The file
                is expected to be in JSONL (JSON Lines) format, where each line
                is a JSON object representing a single test case.
            subset_size (int, optional): The number of examples to load from the
                benchmark file. If set, only the first `subset_size` examples
                will be used. Defaults to 10 for quick evaluations.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the file at `benchmark_path` does not exist.
            ValueError: If `subset_size` is not a positive integer.

## EVALUATION SUMMARY
{evaluation_summary}

## FAILED EXAMPLES WITH AGENT CONVERSATIONS
{FAILED_METRIC}

Please analyze each failed example by carefully reading the agent conversations. For each agent that participated:

1. Examine their specific responses and decisions in the chat
2. Identify which agents made critical errors that led to wrong answers
3. Compare their behavior against their current system message guidelines
4. Determine what specific guidelines are missing or inadequate
5. Provide exact system message modifications for each problematic agent

Focus on agent-specific issues revealed through their actual chat behavior. If an agent performed correctly and didn't contribute to the failure, indicate "NO CHANGE REQUIRED" for that agent.

Your analysis will be used to directly update individual agent system messages, so be precise about which agent needs what specific guideline changes."""
